# tiki15lines
The TikiWiki "Export Wiki Pages" function provides files that contain 15 lines of header information, which is not always useful. This super simple, no-options program just removes the first 15 lines from all the files you place in its "files_here" directory. Ensure you keep a backup as this is a destructive process.
